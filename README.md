# Reporter_Ion_Filter_Proteomics
This little piece of code filters through all of the MS1 scans of an MGF file to identify if all of the associated reporter ions are present. If the reporter ions are present then a fold change identification is run. If the fold change is higher than the set threshold, the entire MS1 will be written to a new MGF file that decreases the search time and file size when compared to the original file. This ensures that scans that cannot be quantified are removed and the overall file is de-cluttered.
